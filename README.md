## Create Phone Number - 2022-04-20
Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.
```
createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"
```

## Sum of Digits / Digital Root - 2022-04-21
Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.
```
    16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
   942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2
```

## Hand Challenge - 2022-04-23
You find a strange mirror that always shows a hand that is moving. 
The hand appears to be alive, and after a lot of questions of "yes" and "no" answer, you know that the hand is trying to teach you a program that is written in HPL (Hand Programming Language)...

## ROTH-13 - 2022-04-24
How can you tell an extrovert from an introvert at NSA? Va gur ryringbef, gur rkgebireg ybbxf ng gur BGURE thl'f fubrf.
I found this joke on USENET, but the punchline is scrambled. Maybe you can decipher it? According to Wikipedia, ROT13 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) is frequently used to obfuscate jokes on USENET.
Hint: For this task you're only supposed to substitue characters. Not spaces, punctuation, numbers etc.
Test examples:
```
"EBG13 rknzcyr." -->
"ROT13 example."

"This is my first ROT13 excercise!" -->
"Guvf vf zl svefg EBG13 rkprepvfr!"
```

## Nth Fibonacci - 2022-04-24
I would like for you to write me a function that when given a number (n) returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

For example:
```
   nthFibo(4) == 2
```
Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.
For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
